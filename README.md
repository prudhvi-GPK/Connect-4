# COMP-841 Practical AI

## **README**

### Team: Prudhvi and Vijay

## Project Title:CONNECT4-AI bot

### Description: 

It is sequential two player game in which the objective is to create a line of four of your own discs that runs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent. In General, all these board games like Chess, Go, Checkers etc. use search algorithms and, in this case, it uses Minmax algorithm which is an example for Depth-First search technique. We have also implemented Reinforcement Learning and Alpha â€“ Beta pruning for solving this game. With the help of a system of observations, actions, and rewards, an agent can repeatedly "play" an environment using this reinforcement learning technique, which also integrates deep neural networks.

### Controls for the game: 
Simply use left/right arrow keys to navigate across different columns of the board and press enter to drop a coin.
